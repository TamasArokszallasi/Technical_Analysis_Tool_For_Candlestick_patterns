I have runned the application with the following setup:
-Dataset between 2000.01.01 and 2024.08.31
-Weekly periodic data
-All European countrys currency agains the Euro. Namely:
HUFEUR
CZKEUR
PLNEUR
RONEUR
BGNEUR
HRKEUR
SEKEUR
DKKEUR
NOKEUR
CHFEUR
GBPEUR
RUBEUR
TRYEUR
ISKEUR

Then i recieved an excel file with two sheets and all the datasets are automatically filled in.
1) All_Raw_Data:
This includes 6 columns:
Date|Open|High|Low|Close|Pair 

The first column shows the datet, the next four are the open, highest, lowest and closing price of that specific pair. The last column represents the fxrate pair.


2) All_Analysed_Data
This includes 5 columns:
Date|Pair|Pattern|Signal|Outcome
-Date: shows the date when a pattern appeared.
-Pair: This represents the pair we are working with.
-Pattern: The cells in this column contains the name of the pattern which appeared on that date.
-Signal: These cells shows if the pattern supposed to be Bullish or Bearish indication.
-Outcome: This is the testing part of the validity of a pattern appearance. The pattern outcome can be True on day 1, 2, 3, 4,5 or false. 

At this point, comes the power of PowerBI.
